                        p
                            | This was our first week where we started developing many of the ideas we have been sketching
                            | out. We also made some great progress on fleshing out our
                            a(href='deliverables.html#pdr') product requirement document
                            | (PDR). We also completed out
                            a(href='deliverables.html#project-pitch') project pitch.
                            | We are excited to review the progress we made this week and get started with our tasks for
                            | next week.

                        h3 What every member did and Project Resources
                        p
                            | Collectively, we worked on the project presentation due April 13. We also split up
                            | responsibilities related to the PDR, then worked together to nail down the scope of the
                            | project and what we wanted to focus on each week. Particularly, after our presentation we
                            | realized that the meditation/yoga aspect was a more appealing feature than we previously realized
                            | so we tailored our PDR so that our garden customization is still present but simple so we can focus on interesting
                            | meditation tools.
                        p 
                            | Furthermore, we each started designing particular base components of our simulation that
                            | would be needed no matter what stretch goals we decided to focus on. In particular, Phi found
                            | some UI components that we could plug into our application and after deciding on a design Matthew
                            | ported the UI component from a
                            a(href='https://github.com/kfarr/aframe-city-builder/tree/f7f7c9c9ade67daa0c3d89c4aeb7f9021ad794d8') city builder game
                            | to work on the Oculus 2 with our plant assets. Similarly Phi got some basic
                            | asset placement and movement working with the UI. A simple way of undoing the last placed asset was added as well.
                            br
                            img(src='assets/img/palette.gif' width='500px')

                            i Showcasing initial prototype of the asset placement UI.
                        p
                            | Since we wanted some simple multiplayer interactions in our garden, Matthew set up Croquet integration
                            | with the project. This facilitates unique "rooms" that can be accessed by anyone by typing in a "room id".
                            | They can thus enter a room with others and view any modifications to the room and see the other players in the room 
                            | since assets are mirrored over using Croquet's view/model system.
                        p
                            | We also needed a simple way to navigate around the garden, so Hristo researched some teleportation based locomotion
                            | techniques and integrated a teleportation based system into our project with predefined checkpoints that the user
                            | may select to teleport to.

                            i Showcasing initial teleport prototype
                        p
                            | Jane focused first on getting music working in A-Frame using
                            a(href='') this music management component.
                            | Once that was complete, she started developing what the meditation UI should look like and what sort of
                            | information we are going to be recording and giving feedback about to the user.
                        p
                            | We also had some fun with blender to get some basic low-poly plants to interact with in our garden.
                            | Hristo, for example, made this nice looking cherry-blossom asset.
                            img(src='assets/img/cherry-blossom.png')
                        p
                            | All in all, good progress was made this week. We are developing our codebase in Glitch and using Github for version
                            | control, so you can see our ongoing project development

                        h3 Plan for Next Week
                        p.
                            Next week we plan on finishing up some of the bugs that we have yet to resolve in the UI and
                            start working on the meditation aspect of the project. In particular, we have assigned ourselves
                            the following:
                        ul
                            li Hristo and Jane:
                                ul
                                    li Finish basic locomotion
                                    li A more elegant asset shall be used to mark a teleportation site
                                    li Start work on meditation-specific UI, add in music selection and integrate locomotion into the UI
                                        ul
                                            li User may select from a number of soundtracks
                                            li The user can select from a menu which meditation technique to use, what music should play, if they would like to teleport, and music volume
                                            li The UI component shall be the same as that used in asset placement
                                            li Write script for initial meditation tutorial
                            li Phi and Matthew:
                                ul
                                    li Finish asset placement UI.
                                        ul
                                            li The y component of the left joystick shall allow the user to rotate the sample object in the user’s hand and when placed the object shall reflect this angle.
                                            li The bug in the asset placement UI that causes the right arrow to intermittently disappear shall be resolved
                                            li Add option for up/down arrows to menu UI to be used in meditation UI
                                    li Investigate meditation feedback mechanisms that may be used to monitor the user
                                        ul
                                            li Use phone to monitor heart rate
                                            li Test oculus quest speaker system, see if microphone can capture breathing
                                            li Explore possibility of webcam capture for capturing body positions

                        h3 Blocking Issues
                        p.
                            We believe we have a good grasp of what our initial product should look like, the
                            only thing left now is to continue to implement it! Right now there are a lot of tasks to do, all of which
                            are currently going smoothly so we don't forsee any major blocking issues the next week.

                        p.
                            In our first week, we got ourselves oriented with the tools we would be
                            using through the WebXR tutorial and discovered possible interesting
                            technologies we could use for our project in Glitch and Croquet through
                            the class tutorials. We created a team discord and set about coming up
                            with an idea for our project.
                        p.
                            We bounced around several before coming up with the idea of a virtual zen
                            garden - with Zendin as our working title! The idea of having a customizable,
                            relaxing open space in the virtual world was something that we all liked the
                            idea of and we came up with plenty of possible extensions from this - meditation,
                            gardening, yoga, and more! Virtual spaces can offer a new social outlet in an
                            interesting medium, and the pandemic has shown how sometimes we all need to get
                            away to our own space, which our virtual zen garden is an option we’re hoping to provide.

                            started creating the basics of our virtual world together! For next week, we’ve scheduled
                            some meetings already to hash out the details of our product pitch presentation and our
                            project requirements document, so we have a solid base to build on while developing.
